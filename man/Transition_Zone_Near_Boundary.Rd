\title{Transition_Zone_Near_Boundary}
\usage{
Transition_Zone_Near_Boundary(map, Z, numZ)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{object returned by function genMap}

\item{Z}{list of zones.}

\item{numZ}{number of the zone whose values will be approximated.}
}
\value{
approximated values of the zone (numZ) given as parameter.
}
\description{
Transition_Zone_Near_Boundary
}
\details{
funtion that approximates the value in a transition zone (which has commun boundary with the map)
by the solution of the Laplace's equation. The numerical resolution of the Laplace's equation will be based on the discretisation
of the data on the grid (map$krigGrid). The domaine of study is a transition zone which have a commun border with the map.
}
\examples{
data(mapTest)
ZK=initialZoning(qProb=c(0.55,0.85),mapTest)
Z=ZK$resZ$zonePolygone # list of zones
lab = ZK$resZ$lab # label of zones
plotM(map = mapTest,Z = Z,lab = lab, byLab = FALSE)
# zone 7 is a transition zone that has commun boundary with the map
numZ = 7
Estimation = Transition_Zone_Near_Boundary(map = mapTest, Z = Z, numZ = numZ)
# compute the cost
cL = Cost_By_Laplace(map = mapTest, Z = Z, numZ = numZ, Estimation = Estimation)
cM = Cost_By_Mean(map = mapTest, Z = Z, numZ = numZ)
print(cL$cost_Laplace)
print(cM$cost_Mean)
# zone 7 is a zone with gradient
