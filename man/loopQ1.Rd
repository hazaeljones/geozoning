\usage{
loopQ1(map, disp = 1, step = 0.075, minSize = 0.012, minSizeNG = 0.001,
  QUIET = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{object returned by function genMa}

\item{disp}{0: no info, 1: some info, 2: detailed info}

\item{step}{loop increment}

\item{minSize}{zone area threshold under which a zone is too small to be manageable}

\item{minSizeNG}{zone area threshold under which a zone will be removed}

\item{QUIET}{run in silence-no display}
}
\value{
a matrix with 6 columns and as many rows as loop elements. Columns contain the following values calculated for each quantile vector:  criterion, cost, cost per label, number of zones, quantile associated probability values and number of non degenerated quantiles.
}
\description{
loopQ1
}
\details{
exploratory loop on probability values associated to quantiles. Performs map zonings for each value of the 1 quantile loop (yielding a 2-label zoning).
