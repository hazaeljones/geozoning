Description: A zoning method and a numerical criterion for zoning quality are available in this package.
   The zoning method is based on a numerical criterion that evaluates the zoning quality.
   This criterion quantifies simultaneously how zones are heterogeneous on
   the whole map and how neighbouring zones are similar. This approach allows comparison
   between maps either with different zones or different labels, which is of importance
   for zone delineation algorithms aiming at maximizing inter-zone variability. An optimisation
   procedure provides the user with the best zonings thanks to contour delineation for a given map.
